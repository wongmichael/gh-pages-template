  		<li>spit in your hand or floor and rub it around on your shoes</li>
  		<li>use sweat</li>
  		<li>sweep the court</li>
  		<li>Stickâ€™Um mat
  			<li>All, you and the members of your team, have to do is step on this, 
  			and it will give your shoes a certain grip. You might have to re-step on it

  			<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nAMp_IB-K4">bad review; dont waste your $</a></li>
  			<li>rough up the bottoms with sandpaper or knife!</li>
  		</li>
  		<li>Don't use shoe traction or other sticky sprays that help renew the grip on the shoe. They work well at first, but then pick up all the dust and dirt on the floor, making the traction even worse than before.
  		<li>clean your shoes bottoms</li>
  		<li>soda, orange juice</li>
  	</ul>
  	# <h2>Or just have a seperate pair ( game shoes ) </h2>
